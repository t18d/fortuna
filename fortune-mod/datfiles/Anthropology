One nods contentedly over the argument, re-assured by anthropological 
footnotes, until one recalls that Ben Jonson – if he had seen that 
passage – would have unhesitatingly cited it as exemplifying Puritan 
self-deception and humbug

The increasing tendency to abstract some anthropological or sociological 
finding from its context, and to flourish it around as if it was 
possessed of some intrinsic value as a typological fact about all human 
societies is actively injurious to history

As lawyers’ place in society, and their status vis-à-vis their clients, 
have dropped, they have been driven to acquire more property.… Unless we 
significantly reduce the number of lawyers as a percentage of the 
population, thereby cutting back the legal process, lawyers will not 
regain their once respected place in our society

For a graduate, those first few years of office life amount to an 
additional degree, in anthropology. It is the second-best education in 
human nature in the world. (The first is dating, where observable 
behaviour is so consistent, so clockwork, as to make an Enlightenment 
humanist have second thoughts about free will.)
