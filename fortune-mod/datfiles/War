if we Westerners were so logical … from where had we got the twisted 
thinking that led to our wars and confrontations? Where had we got our

much about Japan – the honesty and politeness, natural cooperation in 
the group – that seemed normal, very normal

In June 1950 the US and Canberra had claimed as the basis for their 
intervention the fact that North Korea had committed ‘aggression’ across 
an internationally recognized boundary. But in August 1950, just two 
months later and as its troops were moving northwards to the Chinese 
border, the US was able formally to deny that there was ‘any historical 
or legal basis for the division of the peninsula.’

The commander searched my belongings. “Indian?” “British,” I replied. I 
asked in a Syrian dialect if he spoke Arabic; he did and we stayed with 
it. In the top pocket of my rucksack he found wooden prayer beads from 
Baghdad. “Muslim?” he asked. Na’am, yes. He handed back my things and 
told me I was welcome to go anywhere I wanted in the Islamic emirate, 
apologising and asking if I was upset with him

On his accession, Fulk found himself facing a coalition of Odo I, count 
of Blois, and Conan I of Rennes. The latter having seized upon Nantes, 
of which the counts of Anjou held themselves to be suzerains, Fulk soon 
laid siege to it, routing Conan’s army at the battle of Conquereuil (27 
June 992) and re-establishing his suzerainty over Nantes. Then turning 
his attention to the count of Blois, he proceeded to establish a 
fortress at Langeais, a few miles from Tours, from which, thanks to the 
intervention of the king Hugh Capet, Odo failed to oust him. On the 
death of Odo I, Fulk seized Tours (996), but King Robert the Pious 
turned against him and took the town again (997). In 1016 a fresh 
struggle arose between Fulk and Odo II, the new count of Blois. Odo II 
was utterly defeated at Pontlevoy (6 July 1016), and a few years later, 
while Odo was besieging Montboyau, Fulk surprised and took Saumur 
(1026). Satisfied with his accomplishments, Fulk died peacefully on 21 
June 1040, just 970 years before his fifty-ninth birthday

We have nothing to fear from Afghanistan, and the best thing to do is to

It turns out that it is Socrates who has put philosophy in continual 
crisis, by introducing political philosophy, which is always at risk.… 
Therefore all philosophical understanding, as Socrates represents it, 
has to be in the category of crisis, because it always involves a 
problem that comes up as a crisis.… Philosophy is the only case in which 
the being is to be in crisis. And it is in crisis in this double way – 
on the one hand, philosophical, on the other, political.… It’s not 
accidental, therefore, that all his philosophical activity takes place 
during the Peloponnesian War or when he’s on trial
