The only serious designs that I have seen during and since the war which 
dared to touch the note of nobility have been in the comic press. Here 
the artist may still speak without the exhibition standard in his mind 
or the fear of dealers in his heart.… In great epochs of civilization 
many of these comic-paper cartoons would have been thought worthy to be 
put into public frescoes and mosaics for speech with the people: now 
that paintings may only be seen behind barriers by paying gate-money, 
there is ‘no demand for that sort of thing’. It is difficult to maintain 
an ideal in a deal!
