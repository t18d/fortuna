looking back on the exhibitions and press reviews, the collections and 
dispersals at Christie’s, it is easy to see that it [Art] has been 
mainly regulated by dealers and provided as a background for financiers’ 
dinner parties. When its history comes to be written it will doubtless 
be called dealer’s art

I was always told as a young man never to let the media on your farm.

One of the main principles in the formulation of the system of subsidies 
has been that the rules should be objective, easy to apply, and operate 
automatically as far as possible. It is considered that there should not 
be any opportunity for the state to interfere in the content of a 
newspaper by means of the subsidy system or any reason for anxiety that 
such interference could occur. The largest portion of the subsidy is 
distributed in accordance with that principle, although certain forms of 
subsidy do entail scrutiny of the particular case. The system is 
administered by a committee of eight members, five of whom represent the 
five parties in the Riksdag. The committee has a secretariat, which 
processes applications and is responsible for the administrative 
management of the scheme. It publishes annual reports on its activities, 
which also provide a useful basis for continuous public debate on the 
subsidy system and the government’s press policy. Such debate is 
regarded as essential for the effective development of the system

Hors du Parlement, comme il existerait des revues d’idées, il y aurait 
tout naturellement autour d’elles des milieux. Mais ces milieux 
devraient être maintenus à l’état de fluidité. C’est la fluidité qui 
distingue du parti un milieu d’affinité et l’empêche d’avoir une 
influence mauvaise. Quand on fréquente amicalement celui qui dirige 
telle revue, ceux qui y écrivent souvent, quand on y écrit soi-même, on 
sait qu’on est en contact avec le milieu de cette revue. Mais on ne sait 
pas soi-même si on en fait partie ; il n’y a pas de distinction nette 
entre le dedans et le dehors. Plus loin, il y a ceux qui lisent la revue 
et connaissent un ou deux de ceux qui y écrivent. Plus loin, les 
lecteurs réguliers qui y puisent une inspiration. Plus loin, les 
lecteurs occasionnels. Mais personne ne songerait à penser ou à dire : « 
En tant que lié à telle revue, je pense que… »

Wahrlich, das Kupfer, das durch Tagesblätter unter das Volk gebracht

Gefährlich ist nur das unterdrückte Wort, das verachtete rächt sich, das

nachsichtlicher hierin und bedenke, daß große Lügen, die allgemeinen

Being a journalist forces one to go out to find out what is actually 
happening in the world, something that rarely happens to diplomats, and 
certainly does not happen to university people … I was also forced to

not help much in that direction
