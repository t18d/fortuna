uncritical deference, at the level of theory, to quantities … the 
mumbo-jumbo of those latter-day astrologers who stem from Conjuror 
Bentham, whose spells are woven each quarter in the Economic History 
Review, and who for 200 years have been trying to persuade us that 
nothing is real that cannot be counted

Christian name.… Bibliography as used here is not a mechanical 
accumulation, but a working tool, sharpened by the exercise of 
judgement: the mere counting of heads does not come into it
