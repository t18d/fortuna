Were so many errors to be present in the transliteration of someone

This is not thinking, but humanitarian reverie. If the world of business

the rule in ancient Semitic is that when the agent of the verb is known, 
the verb is expressed actively. Virtually always, when the Indo-European 
perspective would lead one to propose an agentive analysis, the Semitic 
construction is expressing another nuance

The main issue with Biblical Hebrew is that the manuscript Masoretic 
Text and even the manuscripts from Qumran are not direct reflections of 
a vernacular language, but rather represent a transmitted form of a 
literary liturgical text. The study of the language of the Hebrew Bible, 
therefore, is essentially a linguistic study of the reception of the 
Hebrew Bible at various periods. This applies, for example, to the study 
of its phonology and morphology, both of which exhibit diversity in 
different reading traditions, and also its syntax, since any study of 
syntax should take account of the accent tradition, which is essentially 
a reception history of the syntax

Until the Middle Ages there was no grammatical analysis which made clear 
the conditions under which Hebrew consonants might seem to disappear, to 
intrude, or to occur in peculiar positions; and, until this analysis was 
done, phenomena which to us seem quite regular may have seemed to 
justify other kinds of disregard of sequence which to us are entirely 
irregular

it would be mistaken to attribute too much importance to distributional 
rules … It is probable that the actual practice of the … speaker and 
writer is governed less by such rules and more by a very largely lexical 
learning, through which people know that the word meaning so-and-so is 
written with this letter rather than that
