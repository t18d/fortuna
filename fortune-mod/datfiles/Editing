Die Kritik war Mommsen wichtiger als die erschöpfende Annotierung. 
Deshalb wandte er sich prinzipiell gegen den im Böckhschen Corpus 
gepflegten Grundsatz, die Inschriften ausführlich zu kommentieren. Ihm

gegebenenfalls abweichende Lesarten. Eingehende Erörterungen wichtiger

And because the errors are few, therefore they are supposed to be 
slight. ‘Der Text ist im Ganzen vortrefllich erhalten,’ says Mr 
Friedlaender on p. 94, ‘die Corruptelen beschränken sich auf einzelne 
Silben oder Buchstaben.’ This groundless affirmation was made in 1895 
and overheard by Nemesis. Four years she waited, and then in 1899 she 
brought out from the arsenals of divine vengeance, if I may so describe 
the Bodleian library, a lost fragment of the Sixth satire, which casts a 
dire illumination upon one short chapter in the history of this 
‘excellently preserved text.’

his husbandry; and he was hampered in addition by peculiarly awkward

That texts circulated in classical antiquity itself in a severely 
corrupt state was not fully realized until the papyrus discoveries of 
the latter part of the nineteenth century. Respect for the idea of the

argument is by its very nature circular and that it is inevitable that 
grammatical and stylistic inductions are applied to the correction of 
the very texts on which, ultimately, they are based

Butterfield’s unfamiliarity with the materials of ancient scholarship 
may not make much difference to the text he constructs … But 
Butterfield’s factual knowledge of the manuscripts contrasts markedly

palaeographical expertise. His account is bewildering in the combination

a lot of scholars try to avoid the time-consuming thought and revisions 
that readers’ reports for journals often demand by publishing their work 
in collective volumes or conference proceedings, genres that have, to my 
mind, seriously degraded the quality of scholarship over the last 
generation or two (and I should say that I too have taken advantage of 
this): the articles in collective volumes are rarely carefully refereed, 
nor are they carefully reviewed.… The collective volume allows authors 
to avoid criticism, publishers to avoid doing serious editing, and 
reviewers to avoid the work of assessing a book’s argument. My own 
experience is that editors of journals are happy to receive careful 
assessments from referees whether they are positive or negative, while 
editors of books tend to sound very unhappy to receive negative 
assessments
