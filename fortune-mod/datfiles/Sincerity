Mais la pensée collective est incapable de s’élever au-dessus du domaine 
des faits. C’est une pensée animale. Elle n’a la notion du bien que 
juste assez pour commettre l’erreur de prendre tel ou tel moyen pour un 
bien absolu. Il en est ainsi des partis.… Les partis les plus 
inconsistants et les plus strictement organisés sont égaux par le vague 
de la doctrine. Aucun homme, si profondément qu’il ait étudié la

la doctrine d’aucun parti

to resent it. Here surely was the face of authority, and also a face one

I am back at work fighting Papists, Fascists and historians. I am 
becoming speechless over Spain, Palestine, Irak and Germany. Everybody 
is very kind to me and pays not the slightest attention
