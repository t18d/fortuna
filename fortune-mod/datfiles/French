We fear Mr Routledge’s edition will not do. It is well printed and

When I began to interview applicants in 1977, interviews were conducted 
in French or German if a candidate was applying for those subjects. Now 
English is the only language that can be used. Almost everyone who knows 
a German novel knows it only in an English translation

the French ’Flu. Its symptoms are that the patient, ordinarily a 
balanced, cautious, sceptical man, is lured into unconditional 
sur­render of his critical faculties when a line of French poetry or 
prose falls under his eyes

Can you imagine a sensitive man going on talking for over one hundred 
nights to people who cut him and never answer? On the second evening, at 
the latest, his nerves would go to pieces and he would either do 
something hysterical, e.g., shake the old man by his shoulders, or slam 
the door, go to his own room and never enter the sitting room again

The mere habituation of American scholars to German prose, through their

Compare the tone of the French and of the English press: the first

In Alfred, in the Northmen, one may read the genius of the English
