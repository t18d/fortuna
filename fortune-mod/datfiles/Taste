Skilled draughtsmanship is less admired today, replaced by ephemeral 
computer-generated imagery; its demise surely accounts in part for the 
contemporary decline in taste and seemliness in design?

After the war, visiting American lawyers, with the establishments of law 
reviews in the USA in mind, would sometimes ask to see the LQR offices;

In the mid-nineties, the FT had a promotion where you collected tokens 
and then redeemed for a discounted made-to-measure suit. I thought it 
very suitable to follow in the old boy’s footsteps. On arriving for my 
first appointment, the foppish young dandy at the door looked me up and 
down, and before I could speak, said, “Financial Times?” with absolute 
disdain

In my view, for a country to boast a good "cuisine" it is not enough for 
good meals to be prepared by a few chefs and served in a handful of 
restaurants. To assess a country's cuisine you need to look at what kind 
of food the average household is having for dinner, how it is prepapred 
and how it tastes. It is the people who collectively shape and define 
the culinary culture of a society and it is this culture that sets the 
standards that restauranters and chefs must then meet in order to be 
successful

As poor countries sprouted a commercial overclass, their mimicry took 
the form of consuming the “best” Old World brands. But it comes down to 
the same thing: self-doubt, at the national and cultural level. The 
luxury trade isn’t evil. But it is sad. There is something pathetic, in 
the original sense of the word, about a certain kind of global luxe 
living: marble floors, white furniture, champagne flutes, too-strong 
fragrances, restaurants with handbag stools. It is not the visual 
naffness. It is the imitation of an aesthetic that is held in ironic 
disdain in its home market

Before the Tatler and Spectator … England had no masters of common
