On the question of "what critics" – I'm sorry to sound terse, but – who 
cares? And why do you? I'm a filmmaker, not an academic. I'm interested 
in analyzing principles of creative process as a practical matter. Such 
information is relevant only to the extent that it helps me and my crew 
do our jobs better

here's a friendly word of advice if you ever are in a dialogue with a 
working filmmaker in the future: When they express their views based on 
their experience actually working in the field, you don't challenge them 
and ask that they cite the words of "critics" to back themselves up

If all the critics and all their books were to disappear tomorrow, 
filmmakers would still make films and their works would still hold the 
same value as before. The most interesting and useful writing on film 
appreciation, are the words of filmmakers on other filmmakers. Critics' 
careers hang on the works of filmmakers – not the other way around. 
Critics live and feed by the graces of artists. That's why you don't ask 
an artist to justify his ideas by citing critics. To me, the question is 
offensive

where the reading of novels prevails as a habit, it occasions in time 
the entire destruction of the powers of the mind: it is such an utter 
loss to the reader, that it is not so much to be called pass-time as 
kill-time
