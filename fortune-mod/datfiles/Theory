The increasing tendency to abstract some anthropological or sociological 
finding from its context, and to flourish it around as if it was 
possessed of some intrinsic value as a typological fact about all human 
societies is actively injurious to history

uncritical deference, at the level of theory, to quantities … the 
mumbo-jumbo of those latter-day astrologers who stem from Conjuror 
Bentham, whose spells are woven each quarter in the Economic History

nothing is real that cannot be counted

His [Colin Clark’s] mistake was one I often see with conservative 
intellectuals, namely the attempt to apply abstract reasoning to social 
questions that can only be understood on the basis of the direct

problems

We are all vulnerable – not just the Chinese. But the Chinese were 
especially vulnerable because they were such a highly ideological 
nation. So they were susceptible to argument and reasoning, even if 
distorted. The Australians were vulnerable for a very different reason, 
namely the lack of the intellectuality needed to counter distorted 
reasoning and logic. That insight in turn was later to give me the clue

Chou Fa-kao was a very good Chinese philologist. He read a good deal of

it would be mistaken to attribute too much importance to distributional

written with this letter rather than that

Bohr and Heisenberg couldn’t discover a mechanical explanation so, to 
save face, they decided that the problem was categorically insoluble.… 
But they went even further. They decided that this decision of theirs 
was final, and they all but forbade anyone from seeking for a solution 
after that. They could not pass a law, of course, so they did the next 
best thing. They created a cult. Anyone who continued to seek a 
mechanical explanation was ridiculed and ostracized

The trouble with the 'Lachmann method' ... a misleading name ... lies 
not in the method itself, which, provided that certain premisses are

Some historians have left off their feudal spectacles and gone over to
