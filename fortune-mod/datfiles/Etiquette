The art of politely circumventing (or "cutting") objectionable people in 
social situations requires nothing more than minimal acknowledgment of 
their presence. If done correctly, Miss Manners assures you, it is the 
perfect etiquette crime: pointed and somewhat devastating, but with the 
victim left unable to identify what exactly just happened

I made it a Rule to forbear all direct Contradiction to the Sentiments 
of others, and all positive Assertion of my own. I even forbid myself 
agreable to the old Laws of our Junto, the use of every Word or 
Expression in the Language that imported a fix’d Opinion; such as 
certainly, undoubtedly, &c. and I adopted instead of them, I conceive, I 
apprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so or so, or it so appears to me 
at present.—When another asserted something that I thought an Error, I 
deny’d my self the Pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of 
showing immediately some Absurdity in his Proposition; and in answering 
I began by observing that in certain Cases or Circumstances his Opinion 
would be right, but that in the present case there appear’d or seem’d to 
me some Difference, &c. I soon found the Advantage of this Change in my 
Manners. The Conversations I engag’d in went on more pleasantly. The 
modest way in which I propos’d my Opinions, procur’d them a readier 
Reception and less Contradiction; I had less Mortification when I was 
found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail’d with others to 
give up their Mistakes & join with me when I happen’d to be in the 
right. And this Mode, which I at first put on, with some violence to 
natural Inclination, became at length so easy & so habitual to me, that 
perhaps for these Fifty Years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical 
Expression escape me
