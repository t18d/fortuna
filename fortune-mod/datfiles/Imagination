How many times have I heard students about to start work for a 
corporation claim that they will spend just two or three years earning 
the money they need, then leave and pursue the career of their choice? 
How many times have I caught up with those people several years later, 
to discover that they have acquired a lifestyle, a car and a mortgage to 
match their salary, and that their initial ideals have faded to the 
haziest of memories, which they now dismiss as a post-adolescent 
fantasy? How many times have I watched free people give up their 
freedom? 
                 --  George Monbiot

The upshot of the romantic supposition that purpose is incompatible with

A person well informed about what kinds of books have been written on 
music can usually ‘place’ an unfamiliar work in a few moments and then 
proceed efficiently to find out whether the first impression was correct

At first glance a list of writings usually informs us of our ignorance, 
and yet one hallmark of a learned person is that this information can be 
endured through a certain confidence due to the shapeliness and weight

large-scale city building has to be led by planners and not architects. 
Architects always get it wrong when given a problem that is too large.

when a group of people think alike most of their brains are redundant …

The ninth chapter is one of the finest monuments of antiquity. Till now 
I was acquainted only with two ways of criticising a beautiful passage: 
the one, to shew by an exact anatomy of it the distinct beauties of it 
and whence they sprung; the other, an idle exclamation or a general 
encomium which leaves nothing behind it. Longinus has shown me that 
there is a third. He tells me his own feelings upon reading it, and 
tells them with such energy that he communicates them. I almost doubt 
which is most sublime, Homer’s Battle of the Gods or Longinus’ 
apostrophe to Terentianus upon it 
                 --  Gibbon
