We’ve got so timid. We’ve said ‘let’s try and save them’. There was a

I’m going to use that money [contributions to Labour] to mobilise in

I think I would be a thorn in the side of unfairness somewhere – an

C’est d’une part l’héritage de la Terreur, d’autre part l’influence de 
l’exemple anglais, qui installa les partis dans la vie publique 
européenne. Le fait qu’ils existent n’est nullement un motif de les 
conserver. Seul le bien est un motif légitime de conservation. Le mal 
des partis politiques saute aux yeux

Mais la pensée collective est incapable de s’élever au-dessus du domaine 
des faits. C’est une pensée animale. Elle n’a la notion du bien que 
juste assez pour commettre l’erreur de prendre tel ou tel moyen pour un 
bien absolu. Il en est ainsi des partis.… Les partis les plus 
inconsistants et les plus strictement organisés sont égaux par le vague 
de la doctrine. Aucun homme, si profondément qu’il ait étudié la 
politique, ne serait capable d’un exposé précis et clair relativement à 
la doctrine d’aucun parti 
                 --  Simone Weil 
%
La fin d’un parti politique est chose vague et irréelle. Si elle était 
réelle, elle exigerait un très grand effort d’attention, car une 
conception du bien public n’est pas chose facile à penser. L’existence 
du parti est palpable, évidente, et n’exige aucun effort pour être 
reconnue. Il est ainsi inévitable qu’en fait le parti soit à lui-même sa 
propre fin. Il y a dès lors idolâtrie, car Dieu seul est légitimement 
une fin pour soi-même 
                 --  Simone Weil 
%
Ainsi la tendance essentielle des partis est totalitaire, non seulement 
relativement à une nation, mais relativement au globe terrestre. C’est 
précisément parce que la conception du bien public propre à tel ou tel 
parti est une fiction, une chose vide, sans réalité, qu’elle impose la 
recherche de la puissance totale

Corruption is invisible, corruption is creepy, corruption is very

to begin to personalize our work, because we are only representatives

We have to get past the idea that all forms of government have been

almost nil. Most of actual civilization is in the future

The purpose of the aristocrat is most emphatically not to work for 
money. His ancestors may have worked in order to amass the fortune which 
he enjoys … but he will seldom do the same. When money is there he

there he ceases to spend, he draws in his horns.… Americans relate all 
effort, all work, and all of life itself to the dollar.… In England, 
public business is its own reward, nobody would go into Parliament in 
order to become rich, neither do riches bring public appointments
