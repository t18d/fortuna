Until a movement can make its weight felt politically it is apt to be 
treated as a negligible quantity in this country. But, after all, it was 
educational work which was mostly wanted then

He [Morris] saw the world divided into a possessing class, with their 
hangers-on, and a vast dispossessed class dependent for life itself upon 
the condition that their employment should be a source of profit to the 
employers, and he saw the resulting competitive struggle, commercial 
booms, followed by commercial depression and want of work, and a chronic 
state for many of what he termed “artificial starvation”

Those shareholders are so linked to that company, it’s really unlikely 
that they’re going to suddenly go, ‘You know what, that company’s 
terrible, I’m going to force them to do something else’

We’ve got so timid. We’ve said ‘let’s try and save them’. There was a 
time when we created these DB schemes. And it was about social 
responsibility and employers understanding that this was deferred pay

I think I would be a thorn in the side of unfairness somewhere – an 
agitator. The inherent unfairness in society is something that I’ve 
wanted to change for as long as I can remember

The best general explanation for the origins of this social movement and 
common discourse around rights remains the collapse of other, prior 
utopias, both state-based and internationalist. These were belief 
systems that promised a free way of life, but led into bloody morass, or 
offered emancipation from empire and capital, but suddenly came to seem 
like dark tragedies rather than bright hopes

Even though we are moving toward a socialized economy, we must

I was not converted by the logic of Karl Marx. Most of us become 
Socialists through our hearts first, and our heads afterwards. It was 
certainly so with me. I felt there was nothing in the world so worth the 
doing as to try to alter conditions

True judgement is found … only in men of character. Judgement, indeed,

She underestimated or did not understand the extent to which a movement 
such as that of the British Labour Party is influenced by sentiment. I 
think her judgement of people was often faulty, for this reason
