Romanticism is the pursuit of the element of illusion in things for its

In my view, for a country to boast a good "cuisine" it is not enough for 
good meals to be prepared by a few chefs and served in a handful of 
restaurants. To assess a country's cuisine you need to look at what kind 
of food the average household is having for dinner, how it is prepapred 
and how it tastes. It is the people who collectively shape and define 
the culinary culture of a society and it is this culture that sets the 
standards that restauranters and chefs must then meet in order to be 
successful

there he ceases to spend, he draws in his horns.… Americans relate all
