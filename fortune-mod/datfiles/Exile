As I have discovered over the years, when Australians are criticised 
they either cry or get indignant. Few reflect on why they are being

His [Colin Clark’s] mistake was one I often see with conservative 
intellectuals, namely the attempt to apply abstract reasoning to social 
questions that can only be understood on the basis of the direct 
practical experience. They find it hard to see the other side of 
problems

It was my first encounter with something that would puzzle me for the 
rest of my career. Here were intelligent, well-educated people put in 
charge of [Australian] foreign policy, but who had almost no interest in 
the reality of the disputes over which they were supposed to create 
policies. How could they do that and remain at ease with their 
consciences?

One day to our collective conservative shock he said blandly that no one 
of intelligence could fail to belong to the progressive leftwing of 
Australian politics. Years later, during the Vietnam War, he was to 
emerge as die-hard anti-communist, totally intolerant of anyone trying 
to point out the insanity of that conflict. Years later I was to call it 
the flip-flop effect – the inability of Australian intellectuals to 
maintain intellectual consistency, or at least to explain belief changes

Australian life has an at­mosphere of often dismaying crudity 
                 --  Arthur Phillips

There is a certain type of Australian intel­lectual who is forever 
sidling up to the cultivated Englishman, insinuating: ‘I, of course, am 
not like these other crude Austra­lians; I understand how you must feel 
about them; I should be spiritually more at home in Oxford or 
Bloomsbury.’

sie [Viennese Jews] verstehen oft so mangelhaft deutsch, dass sie die

M.’s Jews are proud to be Jews and (Bernays!) they are not homosexuals,

[Oswyn] Murray, a professional historian, omits crucial information. He

He [Momigliano] would be the unique example in the modern history of 
classical scholarship of a great male scholar taught by women. Or did he 
simply fear male rivals and sought comfort in a series of adoring women

I continue to learn a great deal from his [Momigliano’s] essays on
