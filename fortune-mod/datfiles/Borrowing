Neuro­sci­en­tists have found that buy­ing on credit ac­ti­vates the 
same re­gion of the brain that an­tic­i­pates the next hit from an 
ad­dic­tive drug. Wall Street’s short­hand for “other peo­ple’s money,” 
OPM, does sound a bit like opium

C’est d’une part l’héritage de la Terreur, d’autre part l’influence de 
l’exemple anglais, qui installa les partis dans la vie publique 
européenne. Le fait qu’ils existent n’est nullement un motif de les 
conserver. Seul le bien est un motif légitime de conservation. Le mal 
des partis politiques saute aux yeux

Wir sollen so lernen, wie die Griechen von ihren Vergangenheiten und 
Nachbarn lernten – zum Leben, also mit größter Auswahl und alles 
Erlernte sofort als Stütze benutzend, auf der man sich hoch – und höher 
als alle Nachbarn schwingt. Also nicht gelehrtenhaft! Was nicht zum 
Leben taugt, ist keine wahre Historie

It turns out that the num­ber of patents in a given tech­no­log­i­cal 
field is only weakly cor­re­lated with its rate of im­prove­ment. A far 
bet­ter pre­dic­tor is a mea­sure of how a patented tech­nol­ogy 
bor­rows from seem­ingly un­re­lated tech­nolo­gies. In­no­va­tion, it 
turns out, can come from any­where, and break­throughs are dri­ven by

paleography is the foundation of all history. There may be historians … 
who have but little knowledge of the science … but then such writers 
rely on the paleographic knowledge of others, who have edited the 
manuscripts which they desire to use, and they have, or ought to have, 
sufficient scholarship to judge which are the best editions, and even 
occasionally to detect editors’ mistakes

Before there was poverty, there had been only juvenile delinquency to

FS do need a different method, system, time-scale, level of accuracy,

Lewis knew Greek and Latin literature, major and minor, early or late, 
medieval and Renaissance, too well to be much impressed by Marlowe’s and 
Shakespeare’s attempts to refashion ancient glory. When he uttered some

little world of English studies he often added, ‘Take it or leave it: 
that is my view.’
