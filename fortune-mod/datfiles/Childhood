quos nos et quales esse velimus et in quo genere vitae, quae deliberatio 
est omnium difficillima. Ineunte enim adulescentia, cum est maxima 
imbecillitas consilii, tum id sibi quisque genus aetatis degendae 
constituit, quod maxime adamavit; itaque ante implicatur aliquo certo 
genere cursuque vivendi, quam potuit, quod optimum esset, iudicare … 
plerumque autem parentium praeceptis imbuti ad eorum consuetudinem 
moremque deducimur; alii multitudinis iudicio feruntur, quaeque maiori 
parti pulcherrima videntur, ea maxime exoptant 
                 --  Cicero

The old slurs and disparaging generalizations at the expense of the 
middle ages are now repeated only by mechanical creatures of habit, by 
those who stopped thinking and reading twenty or thirty years ago, and 
who refuse to give up any catchword or prejudice that was instilled into 
their minds in childhood

by writing sequenced textbooks and by organizing school classes 
according to calendar age, schoolmasters invented, as it were, the 
stages of childhood. Our notions of what a child can learn or ought to 
learn, and at what ages, were largely derived from the concept of a 
sequenced curriculum; that is to say, from the concept of the 
prerequisite…. the mastery of the alphabet and then mastery of all the 
skills and knowledge that were arranged to follow constituted not merely 
a curriculum but a definition of child development. By creating a 
concept of a hierarchy of knowledge and skills, adults invented the 
structure of child development

Misbehavior and punishment are not opposites that cancel each other; on

Hitting children clearly “teaches them a lesson” – and the lesson is 
that you can get your way with people who are weaker than you are by 
hurting them

Even in the high schools and grade schools, superiority or greater 
effort in a few directions could be made a condition. One child might 
develop a superior handwriting, another a superiority in geography, 
another an unusual competence in writing letters, or handling 
correspondence … the critical point would be the pressure brought to 
bear on the child to do extra work, unusually intensive work, and highly 
disciplined work in a particular field … The mere habit of developing 
superiority is a preparation for success in later life

Good parenting is not defined by which decision one makes in each

Man darf dabei nicht von abnormen Zuständen, wie sie bei der Erziehung 
in grossen Städten, zumal in Wien, herrschen, ausgehen; in einem so 
zerstreuenden Getümmel von Menschen und inmitten anziehender Ereignisse 
Knaben zu strebsamen Jünglingen und ernsten Männern erziehen zu wollen, 
das ist nur bei sehr talentvollen Individuen und stillen, in sich 
gekehrten oder bei lebhaften, doch sehr energischen, ideal strebenden 
Naturen in stiller, ethisch sicherer ernster Häuslichkeit möglich

when a group of people think alike most of their brains are redundant … 
the educational process does little to enhance original thinking and a 
great deal to stop it. I’m sure that I’m not the only parent who has 
noticed that the childish habit of asking endless questions disappears 
shortly after kids start school

One day one of my masters caught me reading (in class!) a notebook 
containing texts in my favourite artificial language, called Amtosh, and 
confiscated it. I understand that the masters then held a conference, as 
a result of which the German master, Mr Fritschi, volunteered to teach 
me Latin one-on-one
