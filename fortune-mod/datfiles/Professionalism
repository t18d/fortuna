if those whom we call Architects have to learn to handle not only the 
compasses and square but the brush, the chisel and the modelling tool, 
those whom we call Painters and Sculptors must learn how to create as

The only serious designs that I have seen during and since the war which 
dared to touch the note of nobility have been in the comic press. Here 
the artist may still speak without the exhibition standard in his mind 
or the fear of dealers in his heart.… In great epochs of civilization 
many of these comic-paper cartoons would have been thought worthy to be 
put into public frescoes and mosaics for speech with the people: now 
that paintings may only be seen behind barriers by paying gate-money, 
there is ‘no demand for that sort of thing’. It is difficult to maintain 
an ideal in a deal!

the extreme division and subdivision of art in the present day is one of

First, there is a section called the 'introduction' in which you merely 
describe the general field in which your scientific talents are going to 
be exercised, followed by a section called 'previous work' in which you 
concede, more or less graciously, that others have dimly groped towards 
the fundamental truths that you are now about to expound. Then a section 
on 'methods' – that is OK. Then comes the section called 'results'. The 
section called 'results' consists of a stream of factual information in 
which it is considered extremely bad form to discuss the significance of 
the results you are getting. You have to pretend that your mind is, so 
to speak, a virgin receptacle, an empty vessel, for information which 
floods into it from the external world for no reason which you yourself 
have revealed. You reserve all appraisal of the scientific evidence 
until the 'discussion' section, and in the discussion you adopt the 
ludicrous pretence of asking yourself if the information you have 
collected actually means anything; of asking yourself if any general 
truths are going to emerge from the contemplation of all the evidence 
you brandished in the section called 'results'

Too often to be a coincidence, in my experience, individuals who have 
failed to achieve social mastery in their own environment want to become 
social workers and improve the environment of others. It is a curious 
and significant fact that the field of professional social work, in 
which many of the movements for social reform have originated, requires 
its workers to have a college education and two or three years’ 
post-graduate schooling, but does not require them to possess the 
personality traits or emotional balance necessary for success in normal 
life. I have discouraged hundreds of ambitions to do social work because 
they represented the individual’s escape from the necessity of improving 
himself

Meillet et Vendryès, ce n'étaient pas des normaliens d'ENS. Les 
linguistes n’ont jamais été dans le cadre traditionnel français, parce 
que le cadre traditionnel français, il n'est pas fait pour ça. Une 
préparation à l'ENS, c'est une préparation où on fait de tout. Mais un 
linguiste est un spécialiste.… Et Meillet était dès le départ un 
spécialiste

Butterfield’s unfamiliarity with the materials of ancient scholarship 
may not make much difference to the text he constructs … But 
Butterfield’s factual knowledge of the manuscripts contrasts markedly 
with his forced interpretation of those facts, and his inability to 
handle the ancient evidence is strikingly at odds with his 
palaeographical expertise. His account is bewildering in the combination 
of so much knowledge in one area and so little in significantly related 
ones, so much care in gathering facts and so little in interpreting them

The general audience might be willing to acknowledge the authority of 
professional expertise, but insofar as they saw it as by choice 
exercising no relevant power over their lives, they withheld the 
cultural authority of the historian from men who were to them "merely" 
scholars

Anyone who has looked at ancient commentaries and ancient literary 
criticism will know all too well that they are long on enarratio but 
very short on iudicium, and the same is increasingly true of reviews. 
Far too many of the recent reviews that I have seen, and not just in 
BMCR, bear an unhappy resemblance to the formulaic five-paragraph essay 
American students are taught to write in high school.… I see many such 
reviews; I do not read them

a lot of scholars try to avoid the time-consuming thought and revisions 
that readers’ reports for journals often demand by publishing their work 
in collective volumes or conference proceedings, genres that have, to my 
mind, seriously degraded the quality of scholarship over the last 
generation or two (and I should say that I too have taken advantage of 
this): the articles in collective volumes are rarely carefully refereed, 
nor are they carefully reviewed.… The collective volume allows authors 
to avoid criticism, publishers to avoid doing serious editing, and 
reviewers to avoid the work of assessing a book’s argument. My own 
experience is that editors of journals are happy to receive careful 
assessments from referees whether they are positive or negative, while 
editors of books tend to sound very unhappy to receive negative 
assessments

the APA prescription against numbered sections … prohibits the explicit 
marking of logical organization in a text, with essentially no savings 
in structural compression. We find it disconcerting that applied 
linguists, who should have the most expertise in the discourse factors 
that facilitate reading comprehension, have uncritically adopted a style 
sheet that prohibits the explicit marking of meaning relationships among 
rhetorical sections in a research article.… this discourse style has 
become aesthetically preferred as an end in itself
