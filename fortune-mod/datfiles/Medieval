if some of our own scientific tenets come in their turn to be abandoned, 
we shall be found to have doubly erred in our presentation of medieval 
error

The old slurs and disparaging generalizations at the expense of the 
middle ages are now repeated only by mechanical creatures of habit, by 
those who stopped thinking and reading twenty or thirty years ago, and 
who refuse to give up any catchword or prejudice that was instilled into 
their minds in childhood

Candid inquirers are becoming increasingly convinced that the true 
Renaissance occurred around the twelfth rather than the fifteenth 
century, that medieval Latin and scholasticism possessed great merits, 
that Gothic painting has been neglected just as Gothic architecture and 
sculpture once were, that democracy and popular education declined 
rather than advanced in early modern times, that organized charity and 
care for public health received much attention in medieval towns, whose 
unsanitary streets seem largely a figment of the modern imagination

the extraordinary quality and quantity, the power and the scale, of 
religious art and architecture that survive from the period need some 
explanation. But may it not be a version of the pathetic fallacy to 
suppose that the power of monuments of art to impress us is a reflection 
of the faith of the whole society which produced them

Many medieval historians still seem to assume that, whereas 
intellectuals may have doubted or rejected what they were taught (though 
some deny even that), peasants at any rate will believe anything if only 
they are taught it properly

On his accession, Fulk found himself facing a coalition of Odo I, count 
of Blois, and Conan I of Rennes. The latter having seized upon Nantes, 
of which the counts of Anjou held themselves to be suzerains, Fulk soon 
laid siege to it, routing Conan’s army at the battle of Conquereuil (27 
June 992) and re-establishing his suzerainty over Nantes. Then turning 
his attention to the count of Blois, he proceeded to establish a 
fortress at Langeais, a few miles from Tours, from which, thanks to the 
intervention of the king Hugh Capet, Odo failed to oust him. On the 
death of Odo I, Fulk seized Tours (996), but King Robert the Pious 
turned against him and took the town again (997). In 1016 a fresh 
struggle arose between Fulk and Odo II, the new count of Blois. Odo II 
was utterly defeated at Pontlevoy (6 July 1016), and a few years later, 
while Odo was besieging Montboyau, Fulk surprised and took Saumur 
(1026). Satisfied with his accomplishments, Fulk died peacefully on 21 
June 1040, just 970 years before his fifty-ninth birthday

Until the Middle Ages there was no grammatical analysis which made clear 
the conditions under which Hebrew consonants might seem to disappear, to 
intrude, or to occur in peculiar positions; and, until this analysis was 
done, phenomena which to us seem quite regular may have seemed to 
justify other kinds of disregard of sequence which to us are entirely 
irregular

the so-called "Revival of Learning," that marvelous era when Humanist 
scholars "discovered" classical texts and restored them to mankind after 
the long Gothic night. Medievalists must always smile a little over 
these "discoveries," for we know where the Humanists discovered those 
classical texts – namely, in medieval manuscripts, where medieval 
scribes had been carefully preserving them for mankind over the 
centuries

Lewis knew Greek and Latin literature, major and minor, early or late, 
medieval and Renaissance, too well to be much impressed by Marlowe’s and 
Shakespeare’s attempts to refashion ancient glory. When he uttered some 
particularly scathing remark about some text customarily admired in the 
little world of English studies he often added, ‘Take it or leave it: 
that is my view.’

Some historians have left off their feudal spectacles and gone over to 
contact lenses: that is, they think no one will know that they are 
wearing them if they abjure the 'ism' and use the adjective feudal 
without defining it. Undefined, feudal sometimes seems to mean little 
more than medieval – as in feudal lord, feudal law, feudal government – 
much as it did in the eighteenth century
