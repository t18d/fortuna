One of the main principles in the formulation of the system of subsidies 
has been that the rules should be objective, easy to apply, and operate 
automatically as far as possible. It is considered that there should not 
be any opportunity for the state to interfere in the content of a 
newspaper by means of the subsidy system or any reason for anxiety that 
such interference could occur. The largest portion of the subsidy is 
distributed in accordance with that principle, although certain forms of 
subsidy do entail scrutiny of the particular case. The system is 
administered by a committee of eight members, five of whom represent the 
five parties in the Riksdag. The committee has a secretariat, which 
processes applications and is responsible for the administrative 
management of the scheme. It publishes annual reports on its activities, 
which also provide a useful basis for continuous public debate on the 
subsidy system and the government’s press policy. Such debate is 
regarded as essential for the effective development of the system

The best general explanation for the origins of this social movement and 
common discourse around rights remains the collapse of other, prior 
utopias, both state-based and internationalist. These were belief

offered emancipation from empire and capital, but suddenly came to seem 
like dark tragedies rather than bright hopes

One myth which needs to be taken with a considerable grain of salt is 
that the courts operated as vigilant protectors of liberty. Wherever 
government in some form or other acted repressively, as during the First 
World War against persons suspected of potential disloyalty, or against 
Irish nationalists, or against left-wingers in the inter-war years, or 
right-wingers during the Second World War, the courts were consistently 
prepared to back the authorities; if there was a theory it was that it 
was for Parliament to control the executive, not judges. In so far as 
liberty was protected this was a consequence not of the independence of 
a liberal judiciary, but of the interrelationships between different 
governmental institutions, and of traditions of respect for individual 
rights.… The British judicial tradition of always backing the 
authorities has only in relatively recent times been weakened

Now today, of course, the siloviki like their western luxuries, but I 
don’t know if all this colossal wealth is making them happier or if 
money itself is the most important thing for them. I think one reason 
they steal on such a scale is that they see themselves as 
representatives of the state and they feel that to be any poorer than a 
bunch of businessmen would be a humiliation, even a sort of insult to 
the state. It used to be that official rank gave you top status. Now you

a lot of scholars try to avoid the time-consuming thought and revisions 
that readers’ reports for journals often demand by publishing their work 
in collective volumes or conference proceedings, genres that have, to my 
mind, seriously degraded the quality of scholarship over the last 
generation or two (and I should say that I too have taken advantage of 
this): the articles in collective volumes are rarely carefully refereed, 
nor are they carefully reviewed.… The collective volume allows authors 
to avoid criticism, publishers to avoid doing serious editing, and 
reviewers to avoid the work of assessing a book’s argument. My own 
experience is that editors of journals are happy to receive careful 
assessments from referees whether they are positive or negative, while 
editors of books tend to sound very unhappy to receive negative 
assessments
