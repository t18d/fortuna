Joyce and Stein along with Picasso, Van Gogh, Cézanne and similar

heritage of all educated men; what is false has been gradually rejected,

shortly after kids start school

A man’s personal defects will commonly have with the rest of the world, 
precisely that importance which they have to himself. If he makes light
