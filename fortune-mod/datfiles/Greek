Of course! That is what textual criticism is about: rightness! Which

The ninth chapter is one of the finest monuments of antiquity. Till now 
I was acquainted only with two ways of criticising a beautiful passage: 
the one, to shew by an exact anatomy of it the distinct beauties of it 
and whence they sprung; the other, an idle exclamation or a general 
encomium which leaves nothing behind it. Longinus has shown me that 
there is a third. He tells me his own feelings upon reading it, and 
tells them with such energy that he communicates them. I almost doubt 
which is most sublime, Homer’s Battle of the Gods or Longinus’ 
apostrophe to Terentianus upon it

the Platonic dialogues are imitations precisely because they imitate

That texts circulated in classical antiquity itself in a severely 
corrupt state was not fully realized until the papyrus discoveries of 
the latter part of the nineteenth century. Respect for the idea of the 
‘tradition’ too easily hardened into the assumption that it was more 
likely than not to be right. Critics too easily forgot that critical 
argument is by its very nature circular and that it is inevitable that 
grammatical and stylistic inductions are applied to the correction of 
the very texts on which, ultimately, they are based
