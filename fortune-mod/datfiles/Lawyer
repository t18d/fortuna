Invective is rare today, not that people are kinder, far from it, but 
that they are indifferent; possibly also, being less robust than our 
ancestors, we do not take invective in good part, but go and see a 
lawyer about our prospects of winning a libel action

People claimed to aim to change the world, to exert some influence 
outside of the academy, when it was perfectly clear that their highest 
ambition was tenure. One of the students I started with, among the 
smartest and most well-read in the class, was a strong feminist who 
really did want to change the world. She left after a year to go to law 
school, where she felt that she actually could

The educational system depended, for the serious, primarily on private

a good 50% or more of admissions from the [public] school to Oxbridge 
were (a) either not very clever at all, and simply moulded by an 
expensive education into something half-way presentable; (b) were clever 
but weren’t remotely intellectual and had no real academic interest in 
their subject, meaning Oxbridge was basically a rubber stamp/train 
station for their job in finance/law

As lawyers’ place in society, and their status vis-à-vis their clients, 
have dropped, they have been driven to acquire more property.… Unless we 
significantly reduce the number of lawyers as a percentage of the 
population, thereby cutting back the legal process, lawyers will not 
regain their once respected place in our society

the standard in a profession is always lower than outsiders would

… civil servants, solicitors, administrators, secretaries. For such
