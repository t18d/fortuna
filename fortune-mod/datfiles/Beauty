the prime movers of the Gothic revival had not looked to the proper 
theories, which was not the revival of this or that particular style but 
the revival of art itself, the recovery of an artistic way of doing 
things, of the true artistic temper which would work unconsciously, 
naturally, and therefore beautifully

We have no principles, no unity; the architect, the upholsterer, the 
paper stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer and the potter, run each 
their independent course; each struggles fruitlessly, each produces in 
art novelty without beauty or beauty without intelligence

its [bassoon’s] grotesque capabilities have been exploited to the

In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar

Just as stout women wear black while those with beautiful figures 
disport themselves in colorful dresses, so do pianos most often appear

Of the couples where one partner earns vastly more, the other tends to 
bring cultural clout, grander relatives, a handy passport or some such 
equaliser. (Looks are of insufficient strategic value to close the gap.)

True Criticism is the application of Taste and of good sense to the

You & Mrs Bridges, put me on the track of the Half-Uncial, as you may

Unless the design arises out of the actual construction of a thing it is 
reduced to the level of extraneous ornamentation. Design, in fact, is

The ninth chapter is one of the finest monuments of antiquity. Till now 
I was acquainted only with two ways of criticising a beautiful passage: 
the one, to shew by an exact anatomy of it the distinct beauties of it 
and whence they sprung; the other, an idle exclamation or a general 
encomium which leaves nothing behind it. Longinus has shown me that 
there is a third. He tells me his own feelings upon reading it, and 
tells them with such energy that he communicates them. I almost doubt 
which is most sublime, Homer’s Battle of the Gods or Longinus’ 
apostrophe to Terentianus upon it 
                 --  Gibbon
