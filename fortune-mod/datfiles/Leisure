There may be in America some vulgarity of manner but that’s nothing 
important; it comes out of the pioneer state of things; but, I fear they 
are too much given to making of money & secondly to politics; that they 
make political distinction the end & not the means. And I fear they lack

honor to the community. I am told that things are boasted of in the 
second class of society there that never would be spoken of here
