Another good but boring software company trying to be too big for its 
shoes and pretending to be broad-spectrum-disruptive

Software engineering is in many ways a very pathetic field, because so 
much of it is anecdotal and based on people’s judgments or even people’s 
aesthetic judgments

I wrote to its author asking if GNU could use it. He responded 
derisively, stating that the university was free but the compiler was

A glut of stu­dents trained in the ba­sics of com­puter sci­ence, 
with­out the abil­ity or am­bi­tion to ex­pand the cur­rent state of 
tech­nol­ogy, leads to a glut of en­tre­pre­neurs cre­at­ing

Once we lib­er­ate our­selves from the men­tal cage of think­ing of AI

soft­ware

mod_rewrite should be considered a last resort, when other alternatives 
are found wanting. Using it when there are simpler alternatives leads to 
configurations which are confusing, fragile, and hard to maintain. 
Understanding what other alternatives are available is a very important 
step towards mod_rewrite mastery

The amount of misinformation about selectors is larger than correct 
cross-browser information. The chance of someone doing the right thing 
[optimizing selectors] is pretty low

It has nothing to do with dinosaurs. Good taste doesn't go out of style 
… in many ways C is much superior to C++ (and even more so C#) in both 
its portability and in its availability of interfaces and low-level 
support.… One of the great strengths of C is that it doesn't make you 
think of your program as anything high-level 
                 --  Linus Torvalds

C++ is in that inconvenient spot where it doesn't help make things 
simple enough to be truly usable for prototyping or simple GUI 
programming, and yet isn't the lean system programming language that C 
is that actively encourages you to use simple and direct constructs 
                 --  Linus Torvalds

C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a 
lot of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much 
easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if 
the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out, 
that in itself would be a huge reason to use C

When I started looking at the source code to ld, I was horrified to 
discover that it was all a hand-written parser for a complex linker 
language derived from System V Unix … I got so frustrated that weekly 
I’d rush into my boss’s office in tears saying I couldn’t do it. She’d 
reassure me and I’d go stare at the code some more.… Some things I am 
good at are making things more consistent and making things more 
user-friendly. Cleanup work. I’d done that a lot on other GNU utilities 
for the FSF.… It seems like this happens at most of the jobs I’ve had. I 
end up redefining the job description to be things I’m good at, and 
everyone’s pretty happy with how it turns out
