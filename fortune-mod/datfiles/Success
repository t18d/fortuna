Instagrammers are teased for their pouting selfies and try-hard glamour. 
LinkedIn users are difficult to take seriously in all their 
bumptiousness. But both groups intuit something about life that is often 
lost on more outwardly intellectual Tweeters: projecting success, even 
where it doesn’t exist, can work

Even in the high schools and grade schools, superiority or greater 
effort in a few directions could be made a condition. One child might 
develop a superior handwriting, another a superiority in geography, 
another an unusual competence in writing letters, or handling 
correspondence … the critical point would be the pressure brought to 
bear on the child to do extra work, unusually intensive work, and highly 
disciplined work in a particular field … The mere habit of developing 
superiority is a preparation for success in later life

The present state of affairs is really a perversion of the proper 
working of capitalism. It is all wrong to have millionaires before you 
have ceased to have slums. Capitalism has done enormous good … But the 
perversion has given us too unstable a society. Differences of reward 
must be large enough to induce people to do their best, but the present 
differences are far too great

In my view, for a country to boast a good "cuisine" it is not enough for 
good meals to be prepared by a few chefs and served in a handful of 
restaurants. To assess a country's cuisine you need to look at what kind 
of food the average household is having for dinner, how it is prepapred 
and how it tastes. It is the people who collectively shape and define 
the culinary culture of a society and it is this culture that sets the 
standards that restauranters and chefs must then meet in order to be 
successful

The Success Syndrome that debilitates so many companies also tends to 
create a dependence on consultants which borders on the ludicrous. 
Public relations departments are advised by outside PR firms. Legal 
departments can scarcely make a move without first checking with outside 
counsel. Marketing and advertising people, engineering groups and even 
manufacturing executives feel no qualms about hiring outsiders to 
generate ideas and programs which in most cases are not any better, if 
as good, than those that could be developed internally … In most cases 
the real purpose was never honestly stated since this was either (a) to 
farm out work that should have been done internally (b) to bolster the 
self-confidence of, and pro­vide direction to, executives who had no 
ideas of their own or (c) to help incompetent managers cover their 
tracks by producing rec­ommendations that reinforced actions already 
taken

The majority of people who fail are moved by gossip, friends, or 
neighbors. Such opinions are free; they cost nothing and usually produce 
nothing. The man of definite decision is guided more by his own 
reasoning, faith, and confidence in himself; therefore, he directs his 
own destiny

After a decision is made, the losing side may bring up resistance or

judgment. Eventually you can make decisions swiftly …

reassure me and I’d go stare at the code some more.… Some things I am 
good at are making things more consistent and making things more 
user-friendly. Cleanup work. I’d done that a lot on other GNU utilities 
for the FSF.… It seems like this happens at most of the jobs I’ve had. I 
end up redefining the job description to be things I’m good at, and 
everyone’s pretty happy with how it turns out
