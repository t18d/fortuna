In June 1950 the US and Canberra had claimed as the basis for their 
intervention the fact that North Korea had committed ‘aggression’ across 
an internationally recognized boundary. But in August 1950, just two

border, the US was able formally to deny that there was ‘any historical

The concept of an educated man being allowed by this society to work

the being is to be in crisis. And it is in crisis in this double way –
