My interest in the Pontifical is purely palaeographical

The palaeographical criterion is looked up to as an ideal by many whose 
understanding of palaeography is minimal, and who think that in order to 
make a conjecture palaeographically plausible it is only necessary to 
print it and the transmitted reading in capitals

no amount either of grammar or of palaeography will teach a man one 
scrap of textual criticism

The Bodley is now so cold that I cannot sit there the requisite time for 
due collation

It is no sound palaeography to be too creative and innovative at the 
cost of the verifiable, linguistic basis

It is not so good for the intellect [to do too much palaeographical 
work] and the work is tolerable only when there is a distant literary 
end in view

Until the Middle Ages there was no grammatical analysis which made clear 
the conditions under which Hebrew consonants might seem to disappear, to 
intrude, or to occur in peculiar positions; and, until this analysis was 
done, phenomena which to us seem quite regular may have seemed to 
justify other kinds of disregard of sequence which to us are entirely 
irregular

paleography is the foundation of all history. There may be historians … 
who have but little knowledge of the science … but then such writers 
rely on the paleographic knowledge of others, who have edited the 
manuscripts which they desire to use, and they have, or ought to have, 
sufficient scholarship to judge which are the best editions, and even 
occasionally to detect editors’ mistakes

It is much better … to be able to judge whether a certain document is of 
the age which it professes, or in whose hand a draft of a treaty is, 
than to have to accept the opinion of someone else

It is the broad nib that gives the pen its constructive and educational

You & Mrs Bridges, put me on the track of the Half-Uncial, as you may 
remember, long ago, when you gave me a copy of Maunde Thompson’s Greek & 
Latin Palæography

Butterfield’s unfamiliarity with the materials of ancient scholarship 
may not make much difference to the text he constructs … But 
Butterfield’s factual knowledge of the manuscripts contrasts markedly 
with his forced interpretation of those facts, and his inability to 
handle the ancient evidence is strikingly at odds with his 
palaeographical expertise. His account is bewildering in the combination 
of so much knowledge in one area and so little in significantly related 
ones, so much care in gathering facts and so little in interpreting them
