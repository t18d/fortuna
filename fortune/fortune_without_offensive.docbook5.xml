<refsect1 xml:id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>When
<emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>fortune</emphasis>
is run with no arguments it prints out a random epigram. Epigrams are
divided into several categories.</para>

<refsect2 xml:id='options'><title>Options</title>
<para>The options are as follows:</para>
<variablelist remap='TP'>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-a</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>

<para>Choose from all lists of maxims.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-c</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>Show the cookie file from which the fortune came.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-e</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>Consider all fortune files to be of equal size (see discussion below
on multiple files).</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-f</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>Print out the list of files which would be searched, but don't
print a fortune.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-l</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>Long dictums only.  See
<emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-n</emphasis>
on how “long” is defined in this sense.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-m </emphasis><emphasis remap='I'>pattern</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>Print out all fortunes which match the basic regular expression
<emphasis remap='I'>pattern</emphasis>.
The syntax of these expressions depends on how your system defines
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>re_comp</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> or <citerefentry><refentrytitle>regcomp</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
but it should nevertheless be similar to the syntax used in
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>grep</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

  <blockquote remap='RS'>
<para>The fortunes are output to standard output, while the names of the file
from which each fortune comes are printed to standard error.  Either or
both can be redirected; if standard output is redirected to a file, the
result is a valid fortunes database file.  If standard error is
<emphasis remap='I'>also</emphasis>
redirected to this file, the result is
<emphasis remap='I'>still valid</emphasis>,
<emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>but there will be “bogus”</emphasis>
<emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>fortunes</emphasis>,
i.e. the filenames themselves, in parentheses.  This can be useful if you
wish to remove the gathered matches from their original files, since each
filename-record will precede the records from the file it names.
    </para></blockquote> <!-- remap='RE' -->
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-n </emphasis><emphasis remap='I'>length</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>Set the longest fortune length (in characters) considered to be
“short” (the default is 160).  All fortunes longer than this are
considered “long”.  Be careful!  If you set the length too short and
ask for short fortunes, or too long and ask for long ones, fortune goes
into a never-ending thrash loop.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry>
  <term>
  <emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-s</emphasis>

<emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-n</emphasis>
on which fortunes are considered “short”.</para>
  </listitem>

  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-i</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>Ignore case for
<option>-m</option>
patterns.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-w</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>Wait before termination for an amount of time calculated from the
number of characters in the message.  This is useful if it is executed
as part of the logout procedure to guarantee that the message can be
read before the screen is cleared.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>The user may specify alternate sayings.  You can specify a specific
file, a directory which contains one or more files, or the special word
<emphasis remap='I'>all</emphasis>
which says to use all the standard databases.  Any of these may be
preceded by a percentage, which is a number
<emphasis remap='I'>n</emphasis>
between 0 and 100 inclusive, followed by a
<emphasis remap='I'>%</emphasis>.
If it is, there will be a
<emphasis remap='I'>n</emphasis>
percent probability that an adage will be picked from that file or
directory. If the percentages do not sum to 100, and there are
specifications without percentages, the remaining percent will apply
to those files and/or directories, in which case the probability of
selecting from one of them will be based on their relative sizes.</para>

<para>As an example, given two databases
<emphasis remap='I'>funny</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>not-funny</emphasis>, with <emphasis remap='I'>funny</emphasis>
twice as big (in number of fortunes, not raw file size), saying</para>
  <blockquote remap='RS'>

<para><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>fortune</emphasis>
<emphasis remap='I'>funny not-funny</emphasis>

  </para></blockquote> <!-- remap='RE' -->
<para>will get you fortunes out of
<emphasis remap='I'>funny</emphasis>
two-thirds of the time.  The command</para>
  <blockquote remap='RS'>

<para><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>fortune</emphasis>
90% <emphasis remap='I'>funny</emphasis> 10% <emphasis remap='I'>not-funny</emphasis>

  </para></blockquote> <!-- remap='RE' -->
<para>will pick out 90% of its fortunes from
<emphasis remap='I'>funny</emphasis>
(the “10% not-funny” is unnecessary, since 10% is all that's left).</para>

<para>The
<emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>-e</emphasis>
option says to consider all files equal; thus</para>
  <blockquote remap='RS'>

<para><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>fortune -e</emphasis>
<emphasis remap='I'>funny not-funny</emphasis>

  </para></blockquote> <!-- remap='RE' -->
<para>is equivalent to</para>
  <blockquote remap='RS'>

<para><emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>fortune</emphasis>
50% <emphasis remap='I'>funny</emphasis> 50% <emphasis remap='I'>not-funny</emphasis>

  </para></blockquote> <!-- remap='RE' -->

<para>If a particular set of fortunes is particularly unwanted, there is an
easy solution: delete the associated
<markup>.dat</markup>
file.  This leaves the data intact, should the file later be wanted, but
since
<emphasis role='strong' remap='B'>fortune</emphasis>
no longer finds the pointers file, it ignores the text file.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 xml:id='bugs'><title>BUGS</title>
<para>The supplied fortune databases have been attacked, in order to correct
orthographical and grammatical errors, and particularly to reduce
redundancy and repetition and redundancy.  But especially to avoid
repetitiousness.  This has not been a complete success.  In the process,
some fortunes may also have been lost.</para>

<para>The fortune databases are now divided into a larger number of smaller
files, some organized by format (poetry, definitions), and some by
content (religion, politics).

</para>

</refsect1>

<refsect1 xml:id='history'><title>HISTORY</title>
<para>This version of fortune is based on the NetBSD fortune 1.4, but with a
number of bug fixes and enhancements.</para>

<para>The original fortune/strfile format used a single file; strfile read the
text file and converted it to null-delimited strings, which were stored
after the table of pointers in the .dat file.  By NetBSD fortune 1.4,
this had changed to two separate files: the .dat file was only the header
(the table of pointers, plus flags; see
<emphasis remap='I'>strfile.h</emphasis>),
and the text strings were left in their own file.  The potential problem
with this is that text file and header file may get out of synch, but the
advantage is that the text files can be easily edited without resorting
to unstr, and there is a potential savings in disk space (on the
assumption that the sysadmin kept both .dat file with strings and the
text file).</para>

<para>Many of the enhancements made over the NetBSD version assumed a Linux
system, and thus caused it to fail under other platforms, including BSD.
The source code has since been made more generic, and currently works on
SunOS 4.x as well as Linux, with support for more platforms expected in
the future.  Note that some bugs were inadvertently discovered and fixed
during this process.</para>

<para>At a guess, a great many people have worked on this program, many without
leaving attributions.</para>
