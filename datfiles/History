History seemed a seamless robe instead of a worn garment full of holes

The increasing tendency to abstract some anthropological or sociological 
finding from its context, and to flourish it around as if it was 
possessed of some intrinsic value as a typological fact about all human 
societies is actively injurious to history

anthropology, sociology, and criminology, have evolved either as 
unhistorical disciplines, or with an inadequate historical component, or

Political history is recounted pragmatically in modern scholarship, in

Every account of early Rome struggles to be sufficiently aware of the

The question of who started any given conflict or who is most at fault 
leads to lengthy historical digressions that are antithetical to the 
careful, objective investigation into the contemporary conduct of 
warring parties

We have to get past the idea that all forms of government have been 
tried and that we are locked in to what we have as the best possible … 
Civilization is in its infancy, and we have so far done almost nothing. 
What we know about government – like what we know about science – is 
almost nil. Most of actual civilization is in the future

The vulgar notion of history does not make allowance for the difference

Die von Mommsen gewünschte und beeinflußte »naturwissenschaftliche« 
Modernisierung seines Faches stand im Widerspruch zu der von ihm 
beschworenen Einheit der römischen Altertumswissenschaft. Konnte er

vermochten es nicht mehr

Wir sollen so lernen, wie die Griechen von ihren Vergangenheiten und 
Nachbarn lernten – zum Leben, also mit größter Auswahl und alles 
Erlernte sofort als Stütze benutzend, auf der man sich hoch – und höher

Leben taugt, ist keine wahre Historie

the obscure realm of events that are too fresh for history, but too old 
for journalism; the murky gap of popular perception that covers the

Für meine Vorstellung von wissenschaftlicher Thätigkeit sind Geschichte

paleography is the foundation of all history. There may be historians … 
who have but little knowledge of the science … but then such writers 
rely on the paleographic knowledge of others, who have edited the 
manuscripts which they desire to use, and they have, or ought to have, 
sufficient scholarship to judge which are the best editions, and even 
occasionally to detect editors’ mistakes

I confess that I do not like the idea of giving a man an income which 
would by itself be sufficient to make work unnecessary, and telling him 
to devote himself to research as he pleases.… the temptation to 
desultory research must in every case be very great, and desultory 
research, however it may amuse or benefit the investigator, seldom adds 
much to the real stock of human knowledge.… If we would provide for 
research it must, so far as History is concerned, be done by paying for 
results

The real use of travelling to distant countries and of studying the 
annals of past times is to preserve men from the contraction of mind 
which those can hardly escape whose whole communion is with one 
generation and one neighbourhood, who arrive at conclusions by means of 
an induction not sufficiently copious, and who therefore constantly 
confound exceptions with rules, and accidents with essential properties. 
In short, the real use of travelling and of studying history is to keep 
men from being … Samuel Johnson
