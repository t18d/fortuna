The judgments of the Court [ICJ] are binding in law, but do they, in

One myth which needs to be taken with a considerable grain of salt is 
that the courts operated as vigilant protectors of liberty. Wherever 
government in some form or other acted repressively, as during the First 
World War against persons suspected of potential disloyalty, or against 
Irish nationalists, or against left-wingers in the inter-war years, or 
right-wingers during the Second World War, the courts were consistently 
prepared to back the authorities; if there was a theory it was that it 
was for Parliament to control the executive, not judges. In so far as 
liberty was protected this was a consequence not of the independence of 
a liberal judiciary, but of the interrelationships between different 
governmental institutions, and of traditions of respect for individual 
rights.… The British judicial tradition of always backing the 
authorities has only in relatively recent times been weakened

The so­lu­tion is to cre­ate an in­cen­tive for schools to pro­tect open 
in­quiry – the fear of law­suits. First, uni­ver­si­ties should add a

uni­ver­sity will sum­mar­ily dis­miss any al­le­ga­tion that an 
in­di­vid­ual or group has vi­o­lated a uni­ver­sity pol­icy if the 
al­le­ga­tion is based solely on the in­di­vid­ual’s or group’s 
ex­pres­sion of re­li­gious, philo­soph­i­cal, lit­er­ary, artis­tic,

It turns out that it is Socrates who has put philosophy in continual 
crisis, by introducing political philosophy, which is always at risk.… 
Therefore all philosophical understanding, as Socrates represents it, 
has to be in the category of crisis, because it always involves a 
problem that comes up as a crisis.… Philosophy is the only case in which 
the being is to be in crisis. And it is in crisis in this double way – 
on the one hand, philosophical, on the other, political.… It’s not
