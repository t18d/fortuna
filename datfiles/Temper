Under him [Edward Thring] success in examination was not the great 
object of school training. His care and interest extended beyond the 
clever boy to the average boy and the backward or stupid boy. His theory 
was that every boy is good for something, and he made it his business to 
find out what that was. It was the first school where workshops were 
introduced, and where a boy whose scholarship was beyond hope could 
develop a natural turn, if he had it, for making things with his hands

the prime movers of the Gothic revival had not looked to the proper

naturally, and therefore beautifully

Too often to be a coincidence, in my experience, individuals who have 
failed to achieve social mastery in their own environment want to become 
social workers and improve the environment of others. It is a curious 
and significant fact that the field of professional social work, in 
which many of the movements for social reform have originated, requires 
its workers to have a college education and two or three years’ 
post-graduate schooling, but does not require them to possess the 
personality traits or emotional balance necessary for success in normal 
life. I have discouraged hundreds of ambitions to do social work because 
they represented the individual’s escape from the necessity of improving 
himself

Even in the high schools and grade schools, superiority or greater 
effort in a few directions could be made a condition. One child might 
develop a superior handwriting, another a superiority in geography, 
another an unusual competence in writing letters, or handling 
correspondence … the critical point would be the pressure brought to 
bear on the child to do extra work, unusually intensive work, and highly 
disciplined work in a particular field … The mere habit of developing 
superiority is a preparation for success in later life

We are all vulnerable – not just the Chinese. But the Chinese were 
especially vulnerable because they were such a highly ideological

there he ceases to spend, he draws in his horns.… Americans relate all 
effort, all work, and all of life itself to the dollar.… In England, 
public business is its own reward, nobody would go into Parliament in

Self-deprecation is in almost all cases an assertion of higher status.

Compare the tone of the French and of the English press: the first 
querulous, captious, sensitive about English opinion; the English press 
is never timorous about French opinion, but arrogant and contemptuous

In Alfred, in the Northmen, one may read the genius of the English 
society, namely, that private life is the place of honor. Glory, a 
career, and ambition, words familiar to the longitude of Paris, are 
seldom heard in English speech

A man’s personal defects will commonly have with the rest of the world, 
precisely that importance which they have to himself. If he makes light 
of them, so will other men. We all find in these a convenient meter of

Coarse local distinctions, as those of nation, province, or town, are

If it was impossible to misunderstand the threat, it was also impossible 
to resent it. Here surely was the face of authority, and also a face one 
must accept and even love. One could tell the face it was being rather 
harsh, whereupon it would smile, sympathize, and possibly agree; but it 
was inconceivable that one should defy the face, if only because it was 
entirely innocent of vindictiveness

a lot of scholars try to avoid the time-consuming thought and revisions 
that readers’ reports for journals often demand by publishing their work 
in collective volumes or conference proceedings, genres that have, to my 
mind, seriously degraded the quality of scholarship over the last 
generation or two (and I should say that I too have taken advantage of 
this): the articles in collective volumes are rarely carefully refereed, 
nor are they carefully reviewed.… The collective volume allows authors 
to avoid criticism, publishers to avoid doing serious editing, and 
reviewers to avoid the work of assessing a book’s argument. My own 
experience is that editors of journals are happy to receive careful 
assessments from referees whether they are positive or negative, while 
editors of books tend to sound very unhappy to receive negative 
assessments
