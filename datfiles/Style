First, there is a section called the 'introduction' in which you merely 
describe the general field in which your scientific talents are going to 
be exercised, followed by a section called 'previous work' in which you 
concede, more or less graciously, that others have dimly groped towards 
the fundamental truths that you are now about to expound. Then a section 
on 'methods' – that is OK. Then comes the section called 'results'. The 
section called 'results' consists of a stream of factual information in 
which it is considered extremely bad form to discuss the significance of 
the results you are getting. You have to pretend that your mind is, so 
to speak, a virgin receptacle, an empty vessel, for information which 
floods into it from the external world for no reason which you yourself 
have revealed. You reserve all appraisal of the scientific evidence 
until the 'discussion' section, and in the discussion you adopt the 
ludicrous pretence of asking yourself if the information you have 
collected actually means anything; of asking yourself if any general 
truths are going to emerge from the contemplation of all the evidence 
you brandished in the section called 'results'

I made it a Rule to forbear all direct Contradiction to the Sentiments 
of others, and all positive Assertion of my own. I even forbid myself 
agreable to the old Laws of our Junto, the use of every Word or 
Expression in the Language that imported a fix’d Opinion; such as 
certainly, undoubtedly, &c. and I adopted instead of them, I conceive, I 
apprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so or so, or it so appears to me 
at present.—When another asserted something that I thought an Error, I 
deny’d my self the Pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of 
showing immediately some Absurdity in his Proposition; and in answering 
I began by observing that in certain Cases or Circumstances his Opinion 
would be right, but that in the present case there appear’d or seem’d to 
me some Difference, &c. I soon found the Advantage of this Change in my 
Manners. The Conversations I engag’d in went on more pleasantly. The 
modest way in which I propos’d my Opinions, procur’d them a readier 
Reception and less Contradiction; I had less Mortification when I was 
found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail’d with others to 
give up their Mistakes & join with me when I happen’d to be in the 
right. And this Mode, which I at first put on, with some violence to 
natural Inclination, became at length so easy & so habitual to me, that 
perhaps for these Fifty Years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical 
Expression escape me

there is a third. He tells me his own feelings upon reading it, and

it does not require great expertise in a subject to recognize a weak 
argument; and reviews that look at arguments are generally much more

Anyone who has looked at ancient commentaries and ancient literary 
criticism will know all too well that they are long on enarratio but 
very short on iudicium, and the same is increasingly true of reviews. 
Far too many of the recent reviews that I have seen, and not just in 
BMCR, bear an unhappy resemblance to the formulaic five-paragraph essay 
American students are taught to write in high school.… I see many such 
reviews; I do not read them 
                 --  JEG Zetzel

the APA prescription against numbered sections … prohibits the explicit 
marking of logical organization in a text, with essentially no savings 
in structural compression. We find it disconcerting that applied 
linguists, who should have the most expertise in the discourse factors 
that facilitate reading comprehension, have uncritically adopted a style 
sheet that prohibits the explicit marking of meaning relationships among 
rhetorical sections in a research article.… this discourse style has 
become aesthetically preferred as an end in itself 
                 --  Douglas Biber
