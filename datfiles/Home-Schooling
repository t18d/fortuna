by writing sequenced textbooks and by organizing school classes 
according to calendar age, schoolmasters invented, as it were, the 
stages of childhood. Our notions of what a child can learn or ought to 
learn, and at what ages, were largely derived from the concept of a 
sequenced curriculum; that is to say, from the concept of the 
prerequisite…. the mastery of the alphabet and then mastery of all the 
skills and knowledge that were arranged to follow constituted not merely 
a curriculum but a definition of child development. By creating a 
concept of a hierarchy of knowledge and skills, adults invented the 
structure of child development

Even in the high schools and grade schools, superiority or greater 
effort in a few directions could be made a condition. One child might 
develop a superior handwriting, another a superiority in geography, 
another an unusual competence in writing letters, or handling 
correspondence … the critical point would be the pressure brought to 
bear on the child to do extra work, unusually intensive work, and highly 
disciplined work in a particular field … The mere habit of developing 
superiority is a preparation for success in later life 
                 --  Henry C Link

The educational system, by its very nature, tends to discourage the 
development of specific forms of superiority. It tends to flatten out 
people’s aptitudes rather than to cultivate them

The worship of formal education is one of the outstanding phenomena of 
American history … formal education above the grade school does little 
or nothing to improve personality or character … the prolongation of 
formal education results in a deterioration of personality … due to the 
prolonged postponement of contact with realities

Du, mit deinem Hange zum Goetheschen Deutschland, mit deinem

a good 50% or more of admissions from the [public] school to Oxbridge 
were (a) either not very clever at all, and simply moulded by an 
expensive education into something half-way presentable; (b) were clever 
but weren’t remotely intellectual and had no real academic interest in 
their subject, meaning Oxbridge was basically a rubber stamp/train 
station for their job in finance/law

The very act of individual choice of what was read was potentially 
subversive. Nevertheless it is hard to escape the conclusion that new 
ways of thinking and acting came about despite rather than because of 
education. Literacy might create new possibilities for thought and 
action, but that was not the direct aim of most forms of education

when a group of people think alike most of their brains are redundant …

the Platonic dialogues are imitations precisely because they imitate 
this two-fold structure. They present to you what it means for people to 
understand things as they do, but also show that there is another 
understanding … You could do it apart from Plato, but you’d have to do 
exactly the same thing. And the amazing thing is when people try to do 
it, they in fact don’t do it, but they analyze concepts and end up with 
self-satisfaction.… education was originally designed to save you from 
your own experience
