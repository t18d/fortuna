Academic freedom began to disappear in the fourteenth century when … the 
ius ubique docendi yielded to dependence on charter from pope, king, or 
bishop, royal interference increased, and universities became national 
instead of international

Many medieval historians still seem to assume that, whereas 
intellectuals may have doubted or rejected what they were taught (though 
some deny even that), peasants at any rate will believe anything if only 
they are taught it properly

The United States is rather like the Vatican. It’s very difficult to be 
accepted, you have to follow lots of rules, go to confession and you may 
still end up being damned, rather than going to paradise. The Chinese on 
the other hand are like the two well-dressed young men who knock on your 
door and ask you how you are feeling. They say they also believe in God 
and want to help. It’s the Mormon strategy

you [de Vaux] are unable to treat Christianity any more in an objective

‘Presbyterian’ is not a real subject, because the normal man can get 
through a long life respectably without ever having to think about 
Presbyterianism connotatively, but he cannot get through it without 
having to think about Puritanism and Clericalism as tendencies

The failure of this opposition to obtain institutional expression made

Seeing there a young priest, I said to him – 'Pater, habeo linguam

'Libenter,' and the people revered us both

They are rather in the language of one who takes religion under his 
wing, and finds it – like the virtue of humility – very good doctrine 
for other people. Their author [Selden] will show respect to the 
established religion of his country, but he has no great care what form 
it takes, except as far as it is a powerful political engine which must 
not be suffered to fall into hands which will turn it to a mischievous 
use
