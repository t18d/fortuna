The old slurs and disparaging generalizations at the expense of the

their minds in childhood

Candid inquirers are becoming increasingly convinced that the true 
Renaissance occurred around the twelfth rather than the fifteenth 
century, that medieval Latin and scholasticism possessed great merits, 
that Gothic painting has been neglected just as Gothic architecture and 
sculpture once were, that democracy and popular education declined 
rather than advanced in early modern times, that organized charity and 
care for public health received much attention in medieval towns, whose 
unsanitary streets seem largely a figment of the modern imagination

I made it a Rule to forbear all direct Contradiction to the Sentiments 
of others, and all positive Assertion of my own. I even forbid myself 
agreable to the old Laws of our Junto, the use of every Word or 
Expression in the Language that imported a fix’d Opinion; such as 
certainly, undoubtedly, &c. and I adopted instead of them, I conceive, I 
apprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so or so, or it so appears to me 
at present.—When another asserted something that I thought an Error, I 
deny’d my self the Pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of 
showing immediately some Absurdity in his Proposition; and in answering 
I began by observing that in certain Cases or Circumstances his Opinion 
would be right, but that in the present case there appear’d or seem’d to 
me some Difference, &c. I soon found the Advantage of this Change in my 
Manners. The Conversations I engag’d in went on more pleasantly. The 
modest way in which I propos’d my Opinions, procur’d them a readier 
Reception and less Contradiction; I had less Mortification when I was 
found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail’d with others to 
give up their Mistakes & join with me when I happen’d to be in the 
right. And this Mode, which I at first put on, with some violence to 
natural Inclination, became at length so easy & so habitual to me, that 
perhaps for these Fifty Years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical 
Expression escape me
