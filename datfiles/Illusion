First, there is a section called the 'introduction' in which you merely 
describe the general field in which your scientific talents are going to 
be exercised, followed by a section called 'previous work' in which you 
concede, more or less graciously, that others have dimly groped towards 
the fundamental truths that you are now about to expound. Then a section 
on 'methods' – that is OK. Then comes the section called 'results'. The 
section called 'results' consists of a stream of factual information in 
which it is considered extremely bad form to discuss the significance of 
the results you are getting. You have to pretend that your mind is, so 
to speak, a virgin receptacle, an empty vessel, for information which 
floods into it from the external world for no reason which you yourself 
have revealed. You reserve all appraisal of the scientific evidence 
until the 'discussion' section, and in the discussion you adopt the 
ludicrous pretence of asking yourself if the information you have 
collected actually means anything; of asking yourself if any general 
truths are going to emerge from the contemplation of all the evidence 
you brandished in the section called 'results'

It is like the old question, is it better to love or be loved? Because 
it isn't a toss-up. There is a right answer there, and it isn't even 
close, though most people seem to get it wrong. The Phoenicians want to 
be loved, which is why they become movie stars and celebrities. They 
need that attention. But they soon find out it is empty, because it is 
far better to love than be loved. Loving gives you depth while only 
being loved tends to make you shallow. All art comes from loving, not 
from being loved, which is why these people can't create art. They only 
create simulacra of art, empty shells of creativity which have no 
center.

The main issue with Biblical Hebrew is that the manuscript Masoretic 
Text and even the manuscripts from Qumran are not direct reflections of 
a vernacular language, but rather represent a transmitted form of a 
literary liturgical text. The study of the language of the Hebrew Bible, 
therefore, is essentially a linguistic study of the reception of the 
Hebrew Bible at various periods. This applies, for example, to the study 
of its phonology and morphology, both of which exhibit diversity in 
different reading traditions, and also its syntax, since any study of 
syntax should take account of the accent tradition, which is essentially 
a reception history of the syntax
