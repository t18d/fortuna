The humanists themselves continued to indulge in debates and 
disputations, only they argued whether Hannibal or Scipio was the 
greater man, instead of whether universals were real. The Hellenists 
were for the most part still devoted to Aristotle. In short, 
scholasticism continued almost unabated until Descartes or later

Was not humanism in part an easier way for princes and their sons who 
found the existing university requirements too harsh, and for those in 
general who preferred to write poems, letters, and orations, instead of 
following intricate arguments and arranging their own thought in a 
systematic, orderly manner? To escape this stern necessity, the 
humanists glorified what had been a grammar-school subject, Latin, into 
the sum and substance of culture

poets ever since Donne and Goethe have used imperfect rhymes if they 
couldn't help it – but they never tried to convert a shortcoming into a 
philosophy, and they cer­tainly never quoted their own miscarried

Can you imagine a sensitive man going on talking for over one hundred 
nights to people who cut him and never answer? On the second evening, at 
the latest, his nerves would go to pieces and he would either do 
something hysterical, e.g., shake the old man by his shoulders, or slam 
the door, go to his own room and never enter the sitting room again

Too often to be a coincidence, in my experience, individuals who have 
failed to achieve social mastery in their own environment want to become 
social workers and improve the environment of others. It is a curious 
and significant fact that the field of professional social work, in 
which many of the movements for social reform have originated, requires 
its workers to have a college education and two or three years’ 
post-graduate schooling, but does not require them to possess the 
personality traits or emotional balance necessary for success in normal 
life. I have discouraged hundreds of ambitions to do social work because 
they represented the individual’s escape from the necessity of improving 
himself

it seems to me rather wasteful to focus our energy on debating different

His [Swift’s] irony is like that of Socrates, the irony of intellect.

Die Kritik war Mommsen wichtiger als die erschöpfende Annotierung. 
Deshalb wandte er sich prinzipiell gegen den im Böckhschen Corpus 
gepflegten Grundsatz, die Inschriften ausführlich zu kommentieren. Ihm 
genügten wenige «erklärende Noten», eindeutige Angaben zum Fundort und 
gegebenenfalls abweichende Lesarten. Eingehende Erörterungen wichtiger 
epigraphischer Texte hat Mommsen immer separat veröffentlicht
