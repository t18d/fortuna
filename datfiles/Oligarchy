Now today, of course, the siloviki like their western luxuries, but I 
don’t know if all this colossal wealth is making them happier or if 
money itself is the most important thing for them. I think one reason 
they steal on such a scale is that they see themselves as 
representatives of the state and they feel that to be any poorer than a 
bunch of businessmen would be a humiliation, even a sort of insult to 
the state. It used to be that official rank gave you top status. Now you 
have to have huge amounts of money too. That is what the 1990s did to

The Press, more and more the monopoly of a few rich men, from being the 
organ of democracy has become rather the sounding-board for whatever
