Academic freedom began to disappear in the fourteenth century when … the 
ius ubique docendi yielded to dependence on charter from pope, king, or 
bishop, royal interference increased, and universities became national 
instead of international

He [Morris] saw the world divided into a possessing class, with their 
hangers-on, and a vast dispossessed class dependent for life itself upon 
the condition that their employment should be a source of profit to the 
employers, and he saw the resulting competitive struggle, commercial 
booms, followed by commercial depression and want of work, and a chronic 
state for many of what he termed “artificial starvation”

People claimed to aim to change the world, to exert some influence 
outside of the academy, when it was perfectly clear that their highest 
ambition was tenure. One of the students I started with, among the 
smartest and most well-read in the class, was a strong feminist who 
really did want to change the world. She left after a year to go to law 
school, where she felt that she actually could

We’ve got so timid. We’ve said ‘let’s try and save them’. There was a

it is a source of wonder to me how many people’s beliefs just happen to

How many times have I heard students about to start work for a 
corporation claim that they will spend just two or three years earning 
the money they need, then leave and pursue the career of their choice? 
How many times have I caught up with those people several years later, 
to discover that they have acquired a lifestyle, a car and a mortgage to 
match their salary, and that their initial ideals have faded to the 
haziest of memories, which they now dismiss as a post-adolescent 
fantasy? How many times have I watched free people give up their 
freedom?

Of the couples where one partner earns vastly more, the other tends to

The relative brevity of poetry, combined with the longer time it takes 
to write, would in general seem to make it peculiarly unsuited to 
payment by the sheet, and peculiarly suited to a system of patronage, if

As lawyers’ place in society, and their status vis-à-vis their clients,

For a graduate, those first few years of office life amount to an 
additional degree, in anthropology. It is the second-best education in 
human nature in the world. (The first is dating, where observable

humanist have second thoughts about free will.)

I confess that I do not like the idea of giving a man an income which 
would by itself be sufficient to make work unnecessary, and telling him 
to devote himself to research as he pleases.… the temptation to 
desultory research must in every case be very great, and desultory 
research, however it may amuse or benefit the investigator, seldom adds 
much to the real stock of human knowledge.… If we would provide for 
research it must, so far as History is concerned, be done by paying for 
results
