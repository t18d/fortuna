Candid inquirers are becoming increasingly convinced that the true 
Renaissance occurred around the twelfth rather than the fifteenth 
century, that medieval Latin and scholasticism possessed great merits, 
that Gothic painting has been neglected just as Gothic architecture and 
sculpture once were, that democracy and popular education declined 
rather than advanced in early modern times, that organized charity and 
care for public health received much attention in medieval towns, whose 
unsanitary streets seem largely a figment of the modern imagination

Academic freedom began to disappear in the fourteenth century when … the 
ius ubique docendi yielded to dependence on charter from pope, king, or 
bishop, royal interference increased, and universities became national 
instead of international

the scientific knowledge of the average humanist seldom rose above the

The humanists themselves continued to indulge in debates and 
disputations, only they argued whether Hannibal or Scipio was the 
greater man, instead of whether universals were real. The Hellenists 
were for the most part still devoted to Aristotle. In short, 
scholasticism continued almost unabated until Descartes or later

Was not humanism in part an easier way for princes and their sons who 
found the existing university requirements too harsh, and for those in 
general who preferred to write poems, letters, and orations, instead of 
following intricate arguments and arranging their own thought in a 
systematic, orderly manner? To escape this stern necessity, the 
humanists glorified what had been a grammar-school subject, Latin, into 
the sum and substance of culture

see those folds in paintings of the Last Supper

the so-called "Revival of Learning," that marvelous era when Humanist 
scholars "discovered" classical texts and restored them to mankind after 
the long Gothic night. Medievalists must always smile a little over 
these "discoveries," for we know where the Humanists discovered those 
classical texts – namely, in medieval manuscripts, where medieval 
scribes had been carefully preserving them for mankind over the 
centuries

Lewis knew Greek and Latin literature, major and minor, early or late, 
medieval and Renaissance, too well to be much impressed by Marlowe’s and 
Shakespeare’s attempts to refashion ancient glory. When he uttered some 
particularly scathing remark about some text customarily admired in the 
little world of English studies he often added, ‘Take it or leave it: 
that is my view.’
