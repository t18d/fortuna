a good 50% or more of admissions from the [public] school to Oxbridge

their subject, meaning Oxbridge was basically a rubber stamp/train

If a college desires to have what is called a man of research, I am not

I confess that I do not like the idea of giving a man an income which

research, however it may amuse or benefit the investigator, seldom adds

Lewis knew Greek and Latin literature, major and minor, early or late,

And because the errors are few, therefore they are supposed to be 
slight. ‘Der Text ist im Ganzen vortrefllich erhalten,’ says Mr 
Friedlaender on p. 94, ‘die Corruptelen beschränken sich auf einzelne 
Silben oder Buchstaben.’ This groundless affirmation was made in 1895 
and overheard by Nemesis. Four years she waited, and then in 1899 she 
brought out from the arsenals of divine vengeance, if I may so describe 
the Bodleian library, a lost fragment of the Sixth satire, which casts a 
dire illumination upon one short chapter in the history of this 
‘excellently preserved text.’
