Candid inquirers are becoming increasingly convinced that the true 
Renaissance occurred around the twelfth rather than the fifteenth 
century, that medieval Latin and scholasticism possessed great merits, 
that Gothic painting has been neglected just as Gothic architecture and 
sculpture once were, that democracy and popular education declined 
rather than advanced in early modern times, that organized charity and 
care for public health received much attention in medieval towns, whose 
unsanitary streets seem largely a figment of the modern imagination

Was not humanism in part an easier way for princes and their sons who 
found the existing university requirements too harsh, and for those in 
general who preferred to write poems, letters, and orations, instead of 
following intricate arguments and arranging their own thought in a 
systematic, orderly manner? To escape this stern necessity, the 
humanists glorified what had been a grammar-school subject, Latin, into 
the sum and substance of culture

The worst flaw of modern classical scholarship is the uncritical use of 
modern printed texts, and the most useful service which a young scholar 
can perform today is to trace historically some particular construction

forgetting the testimony of inscription

At least a dozen emendations in the text of Lucan have been afterwards

And because the errors are few, therefore they are supposed to be 
slight. ‘Der Text ist im Ganzen vortrefllich erhalten,’ says Mr 
Friedlaender on p. 94, ‘die Corruptelen beschränken sich auf einzelne 
Silben oder Buchstaben.’ This groundless affirmation was made in 1895 
and overheard by Nemesis. Four years she waited, and then in 1899 she 
brought out from the arsenals of divine vengeance, if I may so describe 
the Bodleian library, a lost fragment of the Sixth satire, which casts a 
dire illumination upon one short chapter in the history of this 
‘excellently preserved text.’

To collate the several hundred extant MSS and to sift from their

Neither in penetration nor in skill was he [Leo] an emendator of the 
first rank: he could restore with ease and felicity a new-found remnant 
of Menander which had only been edited by a Frenchman, but a 
much-laboured field like the text of Juvenal would yield no harvest to 
his husbandry; and he was hampered in addition by peculiarly awkward 
circumstances. Where I had pointed out a fault and proposed a remedy, it 
was necessary for him, after recognising the fault, to propose a remedy 
different from mine

That texts circulated in classical antiquity itself in a severely 
corrupt state was not fully realized until the papyrus discoveries of 
the latter part of the nineteenth century. Respect for the idea of the 
‘tradition’ too easily hardened into the assumption that it was more 
likely than not to be right. Critics too easily forgot that critical 
argument is by its very nature circular and that it is inevitable that 
grammatical and stylistic inductions are applied to the correction of 
the very texts on which, ultimately, they are based

Butterfield’s unfamiliarity with the materials of ancient scholarship

Butterfield’s factual knowledge of the manuscripts contrasts markedly
