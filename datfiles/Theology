We have too long been dependent for our knowledge of the middle ages 
upon collections made in the theological or ecclesiastical interest, 
like Migne’s Patrologia or the Acta Sanctorum, or from the standpoint of 
the national state or language, like the Monumenta Germaniae historica 
and Histoire litteraire de la France

La fin d’un parti politique est chose vague et irréelle. Si elle était 
réelle, elle exigerait un très grand effort d’attention, car une 
conception du bien public n’est pas chose facile à penser. L’existence 
du parti est palpable, évidente, et n’exige aucun effort pour être 
reconnue. Il est ainsi inévitable qu’en fait le parti soit à lui-même sa 
propre fin. Il y a dès lors idolâtrie, car Dieu seul est légitimement 
une fin pour soi-même 
                 --  Simone Weil

You don't get help by going to rich and famous people for advice. Nor do 
you get it by trying to hex the gods with some spell. You get it by 
putting yourself in a position to Nature or the gods where they want to 
help you without being asked. They have to like you, and they don't like 
creepy money-grubbers who are always asking them for cash or cars or 
power. They like people who have high ideals and who are pursuing 
worthy, unselfish goals, against all odds. They like people who thank 
the gods, rather than doubting them or blaming them or haranguing them 
or asking them for undeserved boons. As I have said before, it is not 
what the gods can do for you, it is what you can do for the gods. You 
are their servants, not the reverse

The commander searched my belongings. “Indian?” “British,” I replied. I 
asked in a Syrian dialect if he spoke Arabic; he did and we stayed with 
it. In the top pocket of my rucksack he found wooden prayer beads from 
Baghdad. “Muslim?” he asked. Na’am, yes. He handed back my things and 
told me I was welcome to go anywhere I wanted in the Islamic emirate, 
apologising and asking if I was upset with him
