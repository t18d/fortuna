Invective is rare today, not that people are kinder, far from it, but 
that they are indifferent; possibly also, being less robust than our 
ancestors, we do not take invective in good part, but go and see a 
lawyer about our prospects of winning a libel action

Especially in legal academia the moral of the story has to be spelled

A force de se faire redemander tous, l’ovation, devenue banale, a perdu

The vulgar notion of history does not make allowance for the difference 
between the important and the unimportant; it lets its light shine with 
perfect impartiality or indifference on all periods

Gefährlich ist nur das unterdrückte Wort, das verachtete rächt sich, das 
ausgesprochene ist nie vergebens. Es ist Täuschung oder Schwachsinn, zu 
wähnen, die Rede sei ja fruchtlos gewesen. Was die öffentliche Meinung 
ernst fordert, versagt ihr keiner; was ihr abgeschlagen worden, das 
hatte sie nur mit Gleichgültigkeit verlangt

With Max Weber, finally, the intellectual's self-negation in the morally

Later in Vietnam I was to learn more about the charming habit of Western

It was my first encounter with something that would puzzle me for the 
rest of my career. Here were intelligent, well-educated people put in 
charge of [Australian] foreign policy, but who had almost no interest in 
the reality of the disputes over which they were supposed to create 
policies. How could they do that and remain at ease with their 
consciences?

One need only read his [Housman’s] work and compare him with his

A glut of stu­dents trained in the ba­sics of com­puter sci­ence,

a good 50% or more of admissions from the [public] school to Oxbridge 
were (a) either not very clever at all, and simply moulded by an 
expensive education into something half-way presentable; (b) were clever 
but weren’t remotely intellectual and had no real academic interest in 
their subject, meaning Oxbridge was basically a rubber stamp/train 
station for their job in finance/law

mod_rewrite should be considered a last resort, when other alternatives 
are found wanting. Using it when there are simpler alternatives leads to 
configurations which are confusing, fragile, and hard to maintain. 
Understanding what other alternatives are available is a very important

like the “top secret” designation in government, patents and trade

Very many [EV] articles are generously cluttered with accounts of

I confess that I do not like the idea of giving a man an income which 
would by itself be sufficient to make work unnecessary, and telling him 
to devote himself to research as he pleases.… the temptation to 
desultory research must in every case be very great, and desultory 
research, however it may amuse or benefit the investigator, seldom adds 
much to the real stock of human knowledge.… If we would provide for 
research it must, so far as History is concerned, be done by paying for 
results

C. S. Lewis himself did not call members of our profession ‘academics’,

Jamais Chantraine n’a eu l’idée de commenter, même de loin, le rapport

Anyone who has looked at ancient commentaries and ancient literary 
criticism will know all too well that they are long on enarratio but 
very short on iudicium, and the same is increasingly true of reviews. 
Far too many of the recent reviews that I have seen, and not just in 
BMCR, bear an unhappy resemblance to the formulaic five-paragraph essay 
American students are taught to write in high school.… I see many such 
reviews; I do not read them
