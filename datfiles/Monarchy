Academic freedom began to disappear in the fourteenth century when … the

The best general explanation for the origins of this social movement and 
common discourse around rights remains the collapse of other, prior 
utopias, both state-based and internationalist. These were belief 
systems that promised a free way of life, but led into bloody morass, or 
offered emancipation from empire and capital, but suddenly came to seem 
like dark tragedies rather than bright hopes

One myth which needs to be taken with a considerable grain of salt is 
that the courts operated as vigilant protectors of liberty. Wherever 
government in some form or other acted repressively, as during the First 
World War against persons suspected of potential disloyalty, or against 
Irish nationalists, or against left-wingers in the inter-war years, or 
right-wingers during the Second World War, the courts were consistently 
prepared to back the authorities; if there was a theory it was that it 
was for Parliament to control the executive, not judges. In so far as 
liberty was protected this was a consequence not of the independence of 
a liberal judiciary, but of the interrelationships between different 
governmental institutions, and of traditions of respect for individual 
rights.… The British judicial tradition of always backing the 
authorities has only in relatively recent times been weakened

glaube an diplomatische Aufträge. Er ging auch richtig in die Schlinge

Ausbeute in den Archiven!' Ich wusste sehr wohl, dass es mit seinen 
diplomatischen Aufträgen nicht weit her ist, aber es schmeichelt ihm,

The purpose of the aristocrat is most emphatically not to work for

there he ceases to spend, he draws in his horns.… Americans relate all 
effort, all work, and all of life itself to the dollar.… In England, 
public business is its own reward, nobody would go into Parliament in 
order to become rich, neither do riches bring public appointments
