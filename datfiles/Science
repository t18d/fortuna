Getting through a 17th to 19th century salon was hard work without some

Was not humanism in part an easier way for princes and their sons who 
found the existing university requirements too harsh, and for those in 
general who preferred to write poems, letters, and orations, instead of 
following intricate arguments and arranging their own thought in a 
systematic, orderly manner? To escape this stern necessity, the 
humanists glorified what had been a grammar-school subject, Latin, into 
the sum and substance of culture

First, there is a section called the 'introduction' in which you merely 
describe the general field in which your scientific talents are going to 
be exercised, followed by a section called 'previous work' in which you 
concede, more or less graciously, that others have dimly groped towards 
the fundamental truths that you are now about to expound. Then a section 
on 'methods' – that is OK. Then comes the section called 'results'. The 
section called 'results' consists of a stream of factual information in 
which it is considered extremely bad form to discuss the significance of 
the results you are getting. You have to pretend that your mind is, so 
to speak, a virgin receptacle, an empty vessel, for information which 
floods into it from the external world for no reason which you yourself 
have revealed. You reserve all appraisal of the scientific evidence 
until the 'discussion' section, and in the discussion you adopt the 
ludicrous pretence of asking yourself if the information you have 
collected actually means anything; of asking yourself if any general 
truths are going to emerge from the contemplation of all the evidence 
you brandished in the section called 'results'

Yet even Coleridge admits that there is a certain "nimiety" about the

have always had abundant enthusiasm. But it is easier to be scientific
