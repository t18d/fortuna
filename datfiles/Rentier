once a class dimension is introduced, the problem of intellectual

He [Morris] saw the world divided into a possessing class, with their 
hangers-on, and a vast dispossessed class dependent for life itself upon 
the condition that their employment should be a source of profit to the 
employers, and he saw the resulting competitive struggle, commercial 
booms, followed by commercial depression and want of work, and a chronic 
state for many of what he termed “artificial starvation”

It is like the old question, is it better to love or be loved? Because 
it isn't a toss-up. There is a right answer there, and it isn't even 
close, though most people seem to get it wrong. The Phoenicians want to 
be loved, which is why they become movie stars and celebrities. They 
need that attention. But they soon find out it is empty, because it is 
far better to love than be loved. Loving gives you depth while only 
being loved tends to make you shallow. All art comes from loving, not 
from being loved, which is why these people can't create art. They only 
create simulacra of art, empty shells of creativity which have no 
center.

The present state of affairs is really a perversion of the proper 
working of capitalism. It is all wrong to have millionaires before you 
have ceased to have slums. Capitalism has done enormous good … But the 
perversion has given us too unstable a society. Differences of reward 
must be large enough to induce people to do their best, but the present 
differences are far too great

The reason the UK does not substantively tax land is simply that to do

In the mid-nineties, the FT had a promotion where you collected tokens 
and then redeemed for a discounted made-to-measure suit. I thought it 
very suitable to follow in the old boy’s footsteps. On arriving for my 
first appointment, the foppish young dandy at the door looked me up and 
down, and before I could speak, said, “Financial Times?” with absolute 
disdain

Of the couples where one partner earns vastly more, the other tends to

the middle-class view of the poor guaranteed that, whatever else they 
got – multiservice centers, area-redevelopment programs, 
community-action projects – they would not get money. In fact, the one 
clear policy implication of the “culture of poverty” was that the poor 
could not be trusted with money. And as the view of people who had money 
… there could hardly have been a more brazen defense of the status quo
